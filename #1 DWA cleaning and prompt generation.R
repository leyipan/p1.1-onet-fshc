Firm-specific human capital (FSHC) refers to the knowledge, skills, and abilities that employees acquire through work experience and training in a particular firm which enhance productivity primarily within that particular firm and have limited or no value in external labor markets, whether in the same industry or not. FSHC arises from investments, often jointly made by both employer and employee, in tasks, routines, systems, or relationships that are unique to a firm’s operations. It is characterized by low transferability, contributes to sustained competitive advantage when valuable and hard to imitate, and requires effective retention strategies to ensure that source firms appropriate the value it generates.
We are interested in assessing the potential for a worker to develop FSHC in a particular job/occupation. To do so, we have identified a list of activities, per occupation, from O*NET that underlie the tasks performed in these occupations.

Rate the following job activity from 1 to 5 based on how much firm-specific human capital (FSHC) it is likely to require. Use this scale:

1 – Fully General: Universally transferable; no firm customization.
2 – Mostly General: Standard activity with minor firm-specific elements.
3 – Moderately Firm-Specific: Requires knowledge of firm-specific systems or routines.
4 – Mostly Firm-Specific: Deeply embedded in the firm’s internal logic or workflows.
5 – Fully Firm-Specific: Entirely tailored to the firm’s systems, strategy, or client relationships.

Activity: \"<DWA Title>\"

Respond only with the number 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
